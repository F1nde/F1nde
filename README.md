# GameDev Showcase: Marko Tuominen

A Finnish software developer who loves games and wants to use technologies to create experiences that stir up userâ€™s emotions. A hard working individual who is not afraid to take responsibilities and who has strong basics to learn whatever skills are needed for the job with a Master of Science (Technology) degree from Tampere University of Technology. Always eager to learn new things with particular interest in game/software development, game design, user experiences, software archetypes and software testing. Five years of work experience in the mobile game industry and eleven years of programming experience with C++.

I am currently working on my game project, which I hope to release in 2024. The game's visuals are still under construction, so I don't want to make a post about it just yet. Stay tuned!

Few notes
- I use Bitbucket for my personal projects so that is why contributions activity is empty. This page is more of collace of my work history and own projects.
- Gif quality is intentionally bad so page don't load forever.
- Pinned reposities are some older projects from university times.

Slime Bubbler: Idle Adventures is a casual adventure 3D auto-shooter mobile game released in 2023 for Android. I worked as the lead programmer on the project throughout the entire development cycle of the game and was involved in creating nearly everything featured in the game, in addition to numerous technologies that could be utilized in future projects. My primary focus during the project was on the development side, and my responsibility was to bring the company's vision to life to the best of my ability. Sadly, due to time pressure to release the game, some of its features weren't fully fleshed out, and some were left out entirely. The game marked No Roof Game's first release, and although it didn't achieve commercial success (like most games donâ€™t), it remains a significant milestone for the company. Personally, the project was an invaluable learning experience.

Bomber Friends is a 2D Bomberman-style mobile game released in 2014 that is available for both Android and iOS platforms. I started my work on the game as a client programmer (cocos2d, C++), but in time I extended my work to include game design, quality assurance, backend management (Java-/Typescript), and game server programming (C#), ultimately becoming the main programmer of the game. I had the privilege of contributing to numerous updates and features that were added to the game, which included:
- Designing and implementing over 250 single player levels and played a major role in reworking the single player experience, resulting in improved gameplay and visuals.
- Created 100+ multiplayer maps, was involved in creating new multiplayer game modes like king of the hill and duels, and implemented new weapons on both client and server sides.
- Was responsible for designing and implementing multiplayer balance updates.
- Worked on creating an in-game event system and expanding it over the years, which involved working on over 160 in-game events.
- Back in 2019, I was one of the driving forces for adding and implementing seasonal structure to the game before it was a popular thing to add to mobile games, majorly enhancing player engagement, game revenue and retention.
- Additionally, worked on countless new features including clans, in game fashion shows, daily fortune wheels, single player dungeon runs, sending gifts, new special offers, login rewards, etc.
